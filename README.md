# Hi there, I’m Sriram Madapusi Vasudevan 👋

I’m a Senior Engineer at AWS focused on building **agent-ready developer experiences**. Over the past decade, I’ve worked on large-scale platforms and open-source tooling:

- AWS CloudWatch  
- Rackspace Cloud Queues  
- Rackspace Cloud CDN  
- AWS SAM CLI  
- AWS Lambda Builders  
- AWS Homebrew Tap  

I’m language-agnostic and delight in building short feedback loops that evoke emotion.
